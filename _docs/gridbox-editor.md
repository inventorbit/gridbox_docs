### Drag and Drop Layout Elements 

Layout Elements Consists of Container, Fluid Container, Section and Grid System (Based on the framework you’ve chosen)

To understand the Grid Component you need to understand how the grid system of Twitter Bootstrap/foundation works. 
Grids are the core feature of bootstrap/foundation/ or any CSS frameworks and you will use them often.

The grid has these important properties:
<ul>
<li>The size of each column for the grid system. For example, “4 4 4” will show three columns of size 4. </li>
<li>The total column size is 12. To make it even, add your columns up to 12.</li>
</ul>

### Drag and Drop Components

Any time you select something in the canvas, you will notice that the ELEMENT Properties tab on the left is changing. Any component has specific fields that can be edited to customize its aspect, like  text, class name, color, etc... 

Keep track of your selection in the canvas or using the component tree below the toolbar.
 
### Live Code Editor

Every operation that you might do in the visual builder or with the left sidebar is generating clean and tested code. And where to access this code? - The Code Editor Panel
 
With Gridbox Code Editor you can do full document source editing also it allows you to add external stylesheets, web fonts, scripts, and more.

In Code Editor - Where you can see three different menu items -  HTML, CSS and JS 
 
By default, there will be one CSS(styles.css) and JS(index.js) file automatically created for you (You can’t create multiple CSS and JS Files but you can use CDN JS/CSS Libraries). 

You can create multiple HTML files using "New” Menu.
 
If you want to see the real preview as a website, just click on the preview icon in the top toolbar!
